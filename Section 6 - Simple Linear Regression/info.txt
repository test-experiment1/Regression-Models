simple_linear_regression.ipynb is main file
salary_data is dataset of 2 col. - YearsExperience, Salary & 30 records
-> 	find correlation, simple lin. modal to find best fitting line for this relationship, can give modal for predicting salary to company

# 	Simple linear Regression
// see Screenshot (2612) & Screenshot (2614)
from Screenshot (2614)-> base salary would be 30K which is bo
b1 is slope of line & is extended, plotted on Y-axis to find salary.

# 	how Simple linear Regression find best fitting line
uses OLE to find best fitting line
// see Screenshot (2615)
yi is actual sal. & ŷi is modal/predicted sal.
OLE takes sum of all these (yi-ŷi) & find min. of them which is best fit
------------------------------------------------------------------------
we will train modal on train set
test its performance on test set
